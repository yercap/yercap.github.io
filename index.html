		<h2> Pioneers of Computer Science </h2>
		<p> 
		Two important figures in the field of computer sciecence and mathematics, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are credited with large progression regarding in computational machine language and computer development. Their works and contributions in the world of computer science have paved the way for the modern future of technology we witness today. This unusual pairing of these two Victorian innovators was inspiring; Ada, the first computer programmer, and Charles, an inventor, made visions of a mechanical thing into a reality.
		</p>
		<h2> Charles Babbage </h2>
		<p>
		Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and creator born in London in 1791. His original intention was to introduce English mathematics and developments to the rest of the Europe. During the mid-1800s, Babbage began planning and creating mathematical tables such as calcuators and other computational devices. After he recieved support from the government for such machines that could do such ideas, he developed the Analytical Engine that was a prototype computer and a pioneering machine that would precede the modern computers. This was a massively innovative progresion that would establish the systems and computers that we use today.
		</p>
		<h2> Ada Lovelace </h2>
		<p>
		Augusta Ada Bryone, or Lovelace's original birthname, was the daughter of a famous poet. While her early years as a child were plagued with threats of family separation, she discovered many of her individual interests through her growing years. She is creditted with being the first computer programmer After a brief stunt in growth, she met Charles Babbage. Introducing many computer concepts was an invaluable resource for Charles Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine, and Lovelace was a frequent tester of the protoypes he procured.

		<h1> Jerald Capilo, jcapilo </h1>
		<p>
		My name is Jerald Capilo. I am a Virginia-born student with my family hailing from the Philippines. I originally had an interest in Biochemistry, but my current major is Computer Science with a small personal focus in Music Composition. My family all has history in computer science, and this passion has been passed down to me. Aside from that, I developed my love for music through lessons since I was a child. I hope to use my education to create meaningful content for everyone to enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
		I am intensely devoted to helping others with their personal and overall growth. Empathy is a capacity that I value heavily and try to use it to understand and provide for others as much as possible. I find myself using artistic outlets to find creative ways to bring joy to others, such as music compositions or camera captures of beautiful moments in day-to-day life. As such, if there is anything that you think I might be able to help with, please let me know and allow me to be a part of your works!
