		My name is Jerald Capilo. I am a Virginia-born student with my family hailing from the Philippines. I originally had an interest in Biochemistry, but my current major is Computer Science with a small personal focus in Music Composition. My family all has history in computer science, and this passion has been passed down to me. Aside from that, I developed my love for music through lessons since I was a child. I hope to use my education to create meaningful content for everyone to enjoy.

		I am intensely devoted to helping others with their personal and overall growth. Empathy is a capacity that I value heavily and try to use it to understand and provide for others as much as possible. I find myself using artistic outlets to find creative ways to bring joy to others, such as music compositions or camera captures of beautiful moments in day-to-day life. As such, if there is anything that you think I might be able to help with, please let me know and allow me to be a part of your works!
